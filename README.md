# color_math: Understanding HSV Coordinates

Screen colors are mixtures of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) light. However, RGB mixtures do not map well to the intuitive way people perceive colors. The HSV system translates RGB mixtures to match perception. These reference charts illustrate the HSV Color system components: Hue, Saturation, and Vibrancy. The charts server two purposes. First, they are a quick reference for me when discusses visualization color palettes. Second, they are a basic educational tool for interest colleagues who aren't familiar with the mechanics of on-screen color.

## Key files

+ a0_setup.sh - execute this file first to set up the virtual environment for this code.
+ a1_assemble.py - execute this script to the run the project from end to end (SEE TODO #1)
+ b1_wheels.py - generates the three color wheels shown on this project's webpage.
+ b2_grid.py - generates the Saturation x Vibrancy color grid shown on this project's webpage.


## TODO
- [ ] Finish wiring a1_assemble.py to automatically execute b1_wheels.py and b2_grid.py
- [ ] Proof-read text.
