    <div class="banner">These reference charts illustrate the HSV Color system components: <b>Hue</b>,
        <b>Saturation</b>, and <b>Vibrancy</b>. Screen colors are mixtures of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) light.
        However, RGB mixtures do not map well to the intuitive way people perceive colors.  The
        HSV system translates RGB mixtures to match perception.

    <div class="text"><b>Hue</b> tracks screen colors as overlap from two RGB lights. The 
        top-left color wheel depicts 12 colors formed this way.  For example, image you mix
        red (0°) with blue (240°). You'll get blue-ish purple (Violet), purple (Magenta),
        or redish-purple (Rose), depending on the ratio of red to blue light.
        <br><br>
        <b>Vibrancy</b> tracks how vivid a color looks.  Vibrancy corresponds to average brightness
            of the two RGB lights mixed to form the hue.  The top-right color wheel shows how each
            hue goes from black (V=0.0) to vibrant (V=1.0) as the lights get brighter towards the
            wheel's rim.

    <!-- Row 2 -->
    <div class="visual"><insert>SATxVAL</insert></div>
    <div class="visual"><insert>HUExSAT</insert></div>
    <div class="text">
        <b>Saturation</b> tracks how much light from the third RGB color is mixed with the 1-2
        discussed above.  Third-color light makes colors look washed-out.  If the third
        light is as bright as the other two, the color turns gray.  White light results when all
        three RGB colors are at maximum intensity.  The bottom-left color wheel shows how each
        hue goes from grey (S=0.0) to colorful (S=1.0) as the third color dims.
        <br><br>
        The bottom-right color grid shows how a single hue changes as brightness increases
        (left to right) and saturation decreases (bottom to top). Move the slider bar to
        change hues.
